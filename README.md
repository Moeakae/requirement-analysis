# requirement-analysis
This is for documenting, analysing and structuring requirements for software development
### What is Requirement Analysis?
-Focuses on crafting a comprehensive foundation for software development by documenting, analyzing, and structuring requirements
### Why is Requirement Analysis Important?
| Keys                      | Description
|---------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
| Requirement Gathering     | the process of identifying, documenting, managing the needs and expectations of system
| Requirement Documentation | a crucial process of creating a detailed and agreed-upon specification of what a software system should do and how it should perform
| Requirement Validation    | the process of ensuring that the software requirements, as documented in a SRS
### Key Activities in Requirement Analysis
| Keys                      | Activities
|---------------------------|-----------------------------------------------
| Requirement Gathering     | UNCOVERING ALL STAKEHOLDERS, CURRENT PROCESS MAPPING and UNDERSTANDING THE IMPACT
| Requirement Elicitation   | PREPARATION, NEGOTIATIONS and VERYFICATION
| Requirement Documantation | CREATING, COST EFFICACY, and EXECUTIVE SUMMERY
| Requirement Analysis AND Modeling| LISTING SECURITY, PRIVACY AND COMPLIANCE
| Requirenent Validation    | DEVELOPING, PERFORMING and IDENTIFYING
### Types of Requirements
|Fuctional Requirements                             |Non-fuctional Requirements
-defines what a system should do                    | -defines how the system should do

## Use Case Diagrams
Use Case Diagrams are part of the Unified Modeling Language (UML) and are used in requirement analysis to visually represent how users (actors) interact with a system. These diagrams help stakeholders understand the functional requirements of the system by showing the relationships between users and the various use cases (tasks) the system performs.
###  Benefits of Use Case Diagrams
- **Clarity**: Makes system behavior easy to understand.
- **Communication**: Helps bridge the gap between technical and non-technical stakeholders.
- **Scope Definition**: Defines the boundaries of the system and expected user interactions.
- **Requirement Validation**: Ensures all user needs are captured.

###  Use Case Diagram for ALX Booking System

Below is the use case diagram showing the main actors and their interactions with the booking system:

#### üë§ Actors:
- **Guest**: Can search listings, view listing details, make bookings, and leave reviews.
- **Host**: Can create listings, manage bookings, and respond to reviews.
- **Admin**: Manages users, handles disputes, and oversees the system.

#### üõ† Use Cases:
- **Search Listings**
- **View Listing Details**
- **Book Property**
- **Cancel Booking**
- **Leave Review**
- **Create Listing**
- **Edit Listing**
- **Manage Bookings**
- **Moderate Content**
- **Resolve Disputes**

## Acceptance Criteria
Acceptance Criteria are predefined conditions that a software product must meet to be accepted by the user, customer, or other stakeholders. These criteria are used during requirement analysis and are typically written in plain, non-technical language to ensure mutual understanding between developers and stakeholders.

###  Importance of Acceptance Criteria
- **Clarifies requirements**: Ensures the development team understands what is expected.
- **Defines scope**: Sets clear boundaries for what should and shouldn‚Äôt be developed.
- **Guides testing**: Provides a basis for writing test cases and validating features.
- **Reduces ambiguity**: Avoids misinterpretation of requirements by using measurable outcomes.

###  Example: Acceptance Criteria for Checkout Feature

**Feature**: Checkout Functionality for Booking System

**User Story**:  
As a guest, I want to complete my booking through a secure and user-friendly checkout process so that I can confirm my reservation.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
1. ‚úÖ The user must be able to view a summary of their booking before payment.
2. ‚úÖ The system must validate availability before proceeding to payment.
3. ‚úÖ Payment methods must include at least credit card and PayPal.
4. ‚úÖ An error message should display if payment fails.
5. ‚úÖ The user receives an email confirmation after successful payment.
6. ‚úÖ The booking is marked as ‚Äúconfirmed‚Äù in the database upon successful checkout.
7. ‚úÖ The total cost must include all applicable fees and taxes.

These criteria will be used to validate the implementation of the checkout feature during development and testing.
