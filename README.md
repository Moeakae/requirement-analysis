# requirement-analysis
This is for documenting, analysing and structuring requirements for software development
### What is Requirement Analysis?
-Focuses on crafting a comprehensive foundation for software development by documenting, analyzing, and structuring requirements
### Why is Requirement Analysis Important?
| Keys                      | Description
|---------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
| Requirement Gathering     | the process of identifying, documenting, managing the needs and expectations of system
| Requirement Documentation | a crucial process of creating a detailed and agreed-upon specification of what a software system should do and how it should perform
| Requirement Validation    | the process of ensuring that the software requirements, as documented in a SRS
### Key Activities in Requirement Analysis
| Keys                      | Activities
|---------------------------|-----------------------------------------------
| Requirement Gathering     | UNCOVERING ALL STAKEHOLDERS, CURRENT PROCESS MAPPING and UNDERSTANDING THE IMPACT
| Requirement Elicitation   | PREPARATION, NEGOTIATIONS and VERYFICATION
| Requirement Documantation | CREATING, COST EFFICACY, and EXECUTIVE SUMMERY
| Requirement Analysis AND Modeling| LISTING SECURITY, PRIVACY AND COMPLIANCE

### Types of Requirements
|Fuctional Requirements                             |Non-fuctional Requirements
-defines what a system should do                    | -defines how the system should do

## Use Case Diagrams
Use Case Diagrams are part of the Unified Modeling Language (UML) and are used in requirement analysis to visually represent how users (actors) interact with a system. These diagrams help stakeholders understand the functional requirements of the system by showing the relationships between users and the various use cases (tasks) the system performs.
###  Benefits of Use Case Diagrams
- **Clarity**: Makes system behavior easy to understand.
- **Communication**: Helps bridge the gap between technical and non-technical stakeholders.
- **Scope Definition**: Defines the boundaries of the system and expected user interactions.
- **Requirement Validation**: Ensures all user needs are captured.
